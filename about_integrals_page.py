    The theory of integrals has a rich history dating back to ancient mathematics.
    The development of integration as a concept is closely tied to the invention of calculus.
    
    Some milestones include:
    - Ancient Greek mathematicians like Archimedes using early ideas of summation.
    - The formalization of integration by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century.
    - Riemann's work on definite integrals and the development of Riemann sums.
    - Modern extensions like Lebesgue integration.

    Integrals are used in a wide variety of fields including physics, engineering, and economics.
